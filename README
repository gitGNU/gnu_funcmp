Synopsis
--------

  Functional MetaPost is a Haskell_ frontend to the
  MetaPost_ language by John Hobby. Users write their
  graphics as Haskell programs, which then emit MetaPost
  code that can be compiled into encapsulated PostScript
  files and smoothly included into e.g. LaTeX.

Documentation
-------------

  All these documents are included in the distribution in
  literate Haskell style, but building them is non-trivial
  because it needs additional tools.

  `User's Manual <http://cryp.to/funcmp/legacy-doc/Manual_eng.ps>`_
    A collection of useful examples how to use Functional
    MetaPost. Has little additional explanations, but the
    code is quite enlightening.

  Thesis
    The original thesis describing the implementation. It is
    outdated, but still your best bet right now. The
    Postscript document is originally written in `German
    <http://cryp.to/funcmp/legacy-doc/Thesis.ps>`_, but
    there also is a translated, `English
    <http://cryp.to/funcmp/legacy-doc/Thesis_eng.ps>`_
    version, although it appears to be less complete than
    the german one.

  Tutorial
    Another set of examples with spurious comments thrown
    in. The original Postscript version is written in
    `German
    <http://cryp.to/funcmp/legacy-doc/Tutorial.ps>`_, but it
    has been translated to `English
    <http://cryp.to/funcmp/legacy-doc/Tutorial_eng.ps>`_ as
    well.
