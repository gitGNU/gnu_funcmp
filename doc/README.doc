If you feel like regenerating the English documentation
(Tutorial_eng.lhs and Manual_eng.lhs; the Thesis is still
an ongoing work):

- Install Ralf Hinze's lhs2TeX
  In TeXParser.lhs change the line
            maxLine = 80 * 100
  to
            maxLine = 80 * 500
  Otherwise, lhs2TeX chokes on the large pixel image included in
  Tutorial.lhs

- Install the fmp fonts in your tex system. In my TeX installation
  (teTeX) metapost is not able to initiate automatic font generation,
  so I did a mktextfm fmp{1,8,24} to produce the .tfm files.

- Change %options in the *.lhs file. Hugs needs the enlarged stack
  (-h1m).  The path after -P: must also be set appropriately.

- Look at your .FuncMP file. The size of the documentclass should be
  the same as for the main document.  Besides that the MPINPUTS
  varable must also be set appropriately.

- Generate all the pictures:
  lhs2TeX -math -i lhs2TeX.fmt -lrecalc=True Manual_eng.lhs > /dev/null

  This step may result in lots of "readline: warning:
  rl_prep_terminal: cannot get terminal settings" messages, which are
  harmless.

- Generate the LaTeX file:
  lhs2TeX -math	-i lhs2TeX.fmt -lrecalc=False Manual_eng.lhs > Manual_eng.tex

- latex, latex, dvips
  (xdvi previewing needs "prologues:=2" in the first line of .FuncMP)
